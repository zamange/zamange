üëã Hello there! I'm Zamagcina Ngeyane, a passionate software engineering student with a knack for building innovative solutions using Python, HTML&CSS, Java, and JavaScript.

üíª My journey into the world of coding began with Python, and I've been hooked ever since. Whether it's developing web applications, automating tasks, or diving into data analysis, Python is my go-to tool.

I am knowledgeable in Test Automation, Testing Software with various testing frameworks like JUnit, NUnit, PyTest, etc. 

üìö Currently pursuing my qualification in software engineering at WeThinkCode_, I'm constantly seeking opportunities to expand my knowledge and enhance my skills. I'm actively involved in projects both inside and outside of the classroom, always eager to learn and grow as a developer.

üå± Outside of coding, you can find me exploring the great outdoors, reading a good book, or tinkering with new gadgets. I believe in the power of lifelong learning and am excited to see where this journey takes me next.

ü§ù Let's connect and collaborate on some exciting projects together! Whether you're a fellow developer, a potential mentor, or just someone who shares a passion for all things tech, I'd love to hear from you. Reach me at: zamagcinangeyane6@gmail.com
